js project that simulates the well-known Candy Crush game.

The project contains a login and registration page, a stages page including viewing the highs of all participants, and a game page.

The game page is written at a particularly high algorithmic level. Smart algorithms such as recursion and consideration of very complex edge cases are used.
The game simulates the Candy Crash game as closely as possible - including creating and exploding special candies, limiting time, limiting substitutions, downloading 'lives', and more.
The game is managed with maximum user experience. Background music, appropriate effects, animations, smooth transitions, eye-catching images, and more, which together create an immersive and addictive experience that you cannot tear yourself away from.
